As far as the white rabbit is concerned, it might be better to compare it with the
whole universe. We who live here are microscopic insects existing deep down in the rabbit’s
fur. But philosophers are always trying to climb up the fine hairs of the fur in order to stare right
into the magician’s eyes.

Although philosophical questions concern us all, we do not all
become philosophers. For various reasons most people get so caught up in everyday affairs
that their astonishment at the world gets pushed into the background. (They crawl deep into
the rabbit’s fur, snuggle down comfortably, and stay there for the rest of their lives.)
